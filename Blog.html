    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <td> <img src="images/chie.jpg" width="350" alt=" video editor" <br>

      <p>
        We all need a little inspiration every once in a while.
        <br>When I started video editing, I get my inspirations from influential video editors like <em><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jasonmagbanua" target="_blank">Jason Magbanua</a></strong></em>
        when you are into wedding films,<br>
        <br><em><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjZLzqHYImv4oCJQcZ8Hig" target="_blank">Danniel Schiffer </a></strong></em> for product commercials
        plus the out of this world b-rolls, and <br><em><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/koldstudios">Sam Kolder</a></strong></em> for travel videos.<br>
        <br>It’s really up to you whom to follow BUT REMEMBER: <strong>NEVER IMITATE THEIR STYLE.</strong>
        <br>If you’re merely copying, you’re not learning much at all.
        <br>You can start by imitating, that’s ok. Use other people as a role model<br>but remember to create something that is your own!
        <br><br>
        Whether you are editing a bad-ass action film, a wedding film, or just a simple vlog,<br>
        you’ll have which editing software you want to use. There’s no best or worst editing app or software.<br>
        You can edit on a phone, a PC, or a laptop. Editing will depend on what kind of projects you'll be working on<br>
        and the level of its complexity. Each editing software has something different to offer,<br>
        so I’ve all included the info you need to know, so you can choose the one that’s best for you.<br>

      <h2>Software</h2>
      <center>
        <img src="images/software.jpg" width="450" alt="software images">
      </center><br><br>
      <h4>Premiere Pro</h4>
      For me, this is the best video editing software overall (sorry, finalcut users)<br>
      It’s available for both Mac and PC users and it offers everything you need for professional video editing.<br>
      I love Premiere Pro’s Lumetri Color tool. It offers color adjustment and manipulation almost close to Photoshop.<br>
      It's also flexible, and an easy-to-use interface. I use Premiere Pro in editing some of my baby’s videos,<br> wedding highlights, and
      other video documentaries. <br>
      <h4>FinalCut Pro</h4>
      This editing software runs on Mac personal computers only. So if you are not a Mac user, skip this part and wait for us on the next bullet. <br>
      A lot of famous movies have been edited with this program, such as Social Network, Cold Mountain and many others.<br />
      It is widely known and is very popular among filmmakers. It has a wide range of functionality and is big enough to handle motion
      pictures.<br />

      <h4>Adobe Premiere Elements</h4>

      Are you new to video editing? Then Premiere Elements is your best option. <br>It's a simplified version of Premiere Pro and it's a great place to get started.<br>

      <h4>Da Vinci Resolve</h4>
      This software is simple but enough. If you previously used Premiere,<br />
      you can can import some of your keyboard shortcuts from Premiere to Da Vinci so you won’t have to set it again. <br /> <br />
      What I love about Da Vinci is- it offers universal app support to provide better performance on small laptops <br />
      and it's a powerful tool for color correcting. It's only downside is- it is a little confusing for newbies. <br />

      <h4>LumaFusion</h4>
      No laptop, no pc, no mac? No worries, you can start your editing career on your phone! <br />
      LumaFusion is a mobile editing app for iPhones (ok, skip this if you’re an Android user or think about shifting) <br />
      <br />LumaFusion is a one-time-payment app. That means there’s no monthly or annual subscription, just pay $30 and it's yours for life! <br />
      I use LumaFusion for my same day edit videos (SDEs) because it is convenient.
      <br /><br />You can edit anywhere while having the same quality as PC software editors like Adobe Premiere.
      <br />Haters would say video quality drops when you use a mobile app
      <br />(try telling that to apple, LOL) but don’t believe them, it’s the same quality I tell you.
      <br /><br />You can render 720p to 4k file outputs, perform some color corrections, <br />or import look-up tables (LUTs) in LumaFusion, finally rendering is really fast.

      <h2>Basic Camera Gears</h2>
      <center>

      </center><br><br>
      Before you splurge on camera gears, make sure you really want to do this. Or use what you have at the <br />
      moment-your phone. Cameras are expensive and lenses are more expensive, and drones cost more <br />
      than your groceries! Use what you have and build on the skills first then your gears. <br />
      I will walk you through the most essential camera equipment you need for videography, including some <br />
      of my top recommendations.
      <br /><br />
      <li>Cellphone-smartphones are more convenient and more capable than ever! My best pick is <br />
        iPhone12. It has an ultra-wide lens which you can use for landscape shots and group shots. It also <br />
        has 10-bit recording which gives you can color-grade better during post production. And of course, <br />
        iPhone12 is the best in video-stabilization.</li><br />
      For my top three camera picks:
      <li>Canon</li>
      <li>Sony</li>
      <li>Panasonic</li>
