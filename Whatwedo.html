    <h1>Who is the Annoying Daddy?</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I am Rytchie- your annoying daddy. I created this blog because I wanted to share my passion for<em><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RytHeTv"> videography.</a></strong></em>
      <br>I've been in the field for a couple of years now. Starting from scratch is never easy,
      <br> that is why I want to help beginners to climb <br>their way up the ladder to achieve whatever goals they have in videography.
      <br>This blog is not just about teaching you guys, it is also about me- learning from you.
      <br> I would like to hear your best practices in every blog topic I post.
      <br>Comment down whatever you feel and I'll be glad to have a good chat with you.
    </p>

    <h1>Why "The Annoying Daddy"?</h1>
    <p>I am a dad of a beautiful <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=4097828806899835&set=picfp.100000182683347">4-month-old baby girl</a></em> (still doubting if she's a girl though) She's been the subject of my shoots since the
      coronavirus outbreak.
      <br>I will also be sharing some funny experiences I have as a dad. I don't abuse my daughter, I just ANNOY her, please don't get that wrong.
      And by annoying, I mean cuddling her even if she scratches my face (sigh)-I might change the site name to "the annoying daughter" later on, I'll think about it.
      Lots of parents today want to learn how to capture good photos (or video clips) of a fidgeting toddler (I mean that's hard as f***)- don't worry 'coz we'll be diving into that topic too. There would be lots of topics on this site, that I
      haven't
      thought about yet, but there will be, I promise.
